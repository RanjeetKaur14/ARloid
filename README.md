# Memory Mosaic

**Memory Mosaic** is a modern reimagination of the iconic Microsoft Photo Story. Once a beloved tool for creating narrated photo slideshows, Photo Story allowed users to preserve memories in a deeply personal format. Memory Mosaic brings this experience into the browser age—with updated design, user-focused features, and ethical technology choices.
